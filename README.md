    git clone [https://github.com/Julius-Tindugan/lenshine.git](https://github.com/Julius-Tindugan/lenshine.git)
    cd lenshine
    ```

2.  **Configure Firebase**
    * Create a new project on the [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/).  
    * Add an **Android** and/or **iOS** app to your Firebase project.  
    * Download the `google-services.json` file and place it in the `android/app/` directory.  
    * Enable **Email/Password** authentication in the Firebase console.  

3.  **Set Up the Backend**
    * Start **XAMPP** and ensure the Apache and MySQL services are running.
    * Import the provided `.sql` file into your phpMyAdmin to set up the database schema.
    * Make sure the backend server (Node.js) is running.

4.  **Install Dependencies**
    * Run the following command in your terminal to fetch all the required Flutter packages:
        ```sh
        flutter pub get
        ```

5.  **Run the Application**
    * Connect a physical device or start an emulator.  
    * Run the app using the following command:
        ```sh
        flutter run

## Method #2
- Download the apk-release on our gdrive [Here is the link](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/11tCbQTv8Mmh9GT7TjpUh3ow1qJC0lDF-?usp=sharing)
- We used (https://render.com/) for free to host our server online in cloud so that we can operate the app without using xampp localhost.
- We also used (https://railway.com/) for free hosting of our mysql database in cloud.

- **Download the app package.**

- ** Unfortunately, the server and database will expire its free trial until August 30, 2025 so don't miss out to try our app, so the app will not be available. **
